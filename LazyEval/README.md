Paul Graham's On Lisp (pp. 211-212) contains a simple language for lazy evaluation.
The aim of this exercise is to extend it and make a few abstractions that makes it easier to program in the Lazy Evaluation language of On Lisp.
The task is divided into two parts:
1. make a first rudimentary draft for the extensions.
2. combine the draft version with variable notation ideas from Doug Hyote's defmacro-bang language to make the extensions more elegant to use.

A slightly modified version of the Lazy Evaluation language is utilized, in hopes of helping the garbage collector get rid of unused and unneeded data.
